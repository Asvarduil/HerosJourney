				<p>This week, I've been working on the third and final town in <i>The Hero's Journey</i> - Karikako Fishing Village!</p>
				
				<h4>It takes a Dev to raise a Village</h4>
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-37.png' />
				
				<p>Karikako Fishing Village is a small town by lake Aylea, built around the Aylean Royal Family's summer villa.  In addition to good fishing, scenic vistas, the protective shelter of the southeastern mountain ranges, and good real estate prices, an Evil Lord has recently moved in and started causing trouble.</p>
				
				<p>The other reason why Karikako Fishing Village is being implemented now?  There's a mini-dungeon hidden in the town, that has a key item that will be needed to progress with the plot.  You cannot even hope to access the minidungeon unless you've gotten to the correct point in the plot, though...</p>
				
				<h4>Can I try this minidungeon in, y'know, a webplayer?</h4>
				<p>First things first: I need to finish Karikako first!  That will be in the next webplayer...stay tuned!</p>

				<p>This week, I took it slow on <i>The Hero's Journey</i>, as I was working on the next boss: Lady Barbariccia!</p>
				
				<h4>Villainous Assets</h4>
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-36.png' />
				
				<p>Lady Barbariccia is the second boss of <i>The Hero's Journey</i> and is fundamentally different from Garlan.</p>
				
				<p>First, Lady Barbariccia is an intellectual, unlike Garlan who Tim has to fight blow-for-blow.  She dosen't wear heavy armor, because of this (though she still rocks some skull-emblazoned pauldrons and that odd crown), and instead relies on her potent arsenal of Blue Magic for her combat needs.</p>
				
				<p>Also, as you can see I've built her 'intro' scene, the Manseles Mountain Paths.  The Manselesean Mountains are clear in the background, but more to the point, it is at this point in the game that things will start to get more complex.  For one thing, you'll be forced to find a key item outside of a dungeon, with clues that the player has to piece together by talking to NPCs!  Also, certain sidequests will open up at this point.</p>
				
				<h4>A Quest!  May I undertake it in a webplayer, prithee?</h4>
				<p>Not this week...but, I'm getting close to another webplayer, so fret not!</p>

				<p>This week, some less-glamorous, but totally necessary work was done on the game.</p>
				
				<h4>I hereby grant you a title.</h4>
				<p>I've been working on the startup sequence of the game.  By 'startup sequence', I'm referring to the startup scene, that prepares everything, as well as the Title Screen which is the player's initial access point to the game.</p>
				
				<p>One of the lessons learned earlier in my dev cycle is that my GUI needs to scale well to the aspect ratio of the screen the player is playing on; sure, I could attempt to force the player to play my game in 640x480 resolution, but what about people with widescreen?  Sadly, it's a problem I'm still solving; while my buttons, sliders, checkboxes, labels, and various other GUI controls all work as they 'should', images, which form the backdrops for most of these controls are generally just images, and images aren't behaving in my relative setup.</p>
				
				<h4>I've been saved!</h4>
				<p>The other thing I've been working on is the save and load system.  Not glamorous, filled with cool visual effects, but it's a necessity - people have to stop playing my game sometime, even as short as my game is.  Fortunately, my setup allows me to keep track of what the player does and does not have; all I'm working on are good ways to save the file correctly under the correct circumstances; Android devices will require special permissions, PC can save to a specific location, webplayer can't save at all thanks to Unity's security model for webplayer.</p>
				
				<p>When development gets significantly closer to completion, I'll be asking for volunteers to test the Save/Load system.  Until then, just realize that I've got it in and am testing it in-house.</p>
				
				<h4>Speaking of, player?</h4>
				<p>No, not this week; I'm working on the back end concerns, and making sure my preview build can show off the title screen without trying to do things that can't be done.</p>

				<p>This has been a huge week for <i>The Hero's Journey!</i>  I've been working on some improved special effects, a brand new enemy you'll see a lot of in Barbariccia's Evil Castle, and some bugfixes to previous problems.</p>
				
				<h4>Teleghast for you, sir!</h4>
				<p>First things first, I would like you to meet the new enemy, the Teleghast!<br /><br />
				
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-34.png' /><br />
				<h6>Pictured here: the most annoying ghost you'll ever want to bust.</h6>
				
				The Teleghast will teleport around to various points, and fire a Blue Magic projectile at you.  At first, you can't do a lot about the blue magic, until you find a certain powerup.  Of course, the Teleghasts are vulnerable to being stabbed; they do stick around to watch their bullet fly away for a short time, but will swiftly teleport away.<br /><br />
				
				The Blue Magic projectile is something I'm especially proud of!  It combines legacy particles, existing scripts, and a custom tag to make for an effect that I didn't have to sprite.  This was a positive particle experience, and is one I may go back and apply to the Shototo's particle.  Only, instead of making that one a flashy bit of Blue Magic, it'll probably be a big ball of dust that can injure Tim for half a heart.</p>
				
				<h4>Bugfixes Ahoy!</h4>
				<p>Another thing I did this week was fix various bugs that have crept in over time.<br /><br />
				
				First, NPCs face you as you pass them, once again.<br /><br />
				Also the Shototo's AI was broken, making it do absolutely nothing; this has been remedied.<br /><br />
				
				I added some interior music to the houses, as it was found to be a bit distracting that the Town music would restart once you entered a house; it was felt that, true to the inspiration for this game, that house interiors should have their own music.  At some point I intend to go back to the Maestro audio controller and do something with it such that the music system lives across scenes, but that's too much work as it is; I've already blown my time budget once, I need to get this game finished!<br /><br />
				
				More bugfixes, and features, and content, next week!
				</p>
				
				<h4>Speaking of, webplayer?</h4>
				<p>
				<a href='./webplayer.html'><i class='icon-gamepad'></i> I never thought you'd ask.</a><br /><br />
				
				Note that you'll only see the fruits of the bugfixes in this build; the Teleghasts will come into play sometime this week, as I flesh out the next plot events, and start on Barbariccia's Evil Castle.

				<h4>Louis, Lois, and Clark</h4>
				<p>So, I've continued work on the World Map. Given the comments and critiques on the Small Works Art thread, I've changed a thing or two since last time! <i>(Screenshots working on being re-added!)</i></p>

				<p>The first screenshot features none other than an Evil Castle, where one of the Evil Lords is basing their efforts at reviving the Supreme Evil Lord!</p>

				<p>The second screenshot is an update of my first world map screenshot. While making it look more 'natural' (I still need to add some tree sprite variants), I'm trying to preserve the shape and color consistency.</p>

				<p>On that note, let's talk about that. While I am a programmer, and obviously not the go-to guy for art styles, my art has a clear 'retro' influence, but from far before the days of the NES, Dragon Warrior/Final Fantasy I, or even The Lord of the Rings. No, the driving force behind my style is actually European medieval art!</p>

				<img src='http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/de/Reconstruction_of_the_temple_of_Jerusalem.jpg' />

				<p>Notice how flat everything is? How the more important structures/people are bigger, with more detail put into them? Go back and look at my prior screenshots. Notice anything similar? Sure, one may be more pixelated than the other, but you should see a few conceptual similarities. Given how intentionally 'flat' the Kingdom of Aylea is, this also reinforces the story of the game, and the deconstruction of the RPG tropes I will be exploring.</p>

				<h4>Prithee, hast thou a legendary Webplayer?</h4>
				<p>Egads! Thou hast caught me flatfooting! Mine webplayer still seeketh not the light of daye, as the world map controller hath not the maturity nor the purity of form to present, lords and ladies. But fear not - like the game itself, it shall be come when thou least expecteth it.</p>

				<h4>A Venture in Adventure</h4>
				<p>While working on the town demo, I walled off the entrances to the town of Dunamne. But, this got me thinking: what the heck am I doing? Yeah, I have a town that proves that I can bind a door to a scene, but is that really all I want to demo to my fellow developers?</p>

				<p>Nah. I want to do more. Part of what pumped me up to do The Hero's Journey in the first place was doing something a little different than what I'd done before, a little riskier. So, this week, I set out to do the second part of my demo: the dreaded world map.  <i>(Working on adding image!)</i></p>

				<p>The premise is simple - as other devs have put it, the world map adds a sense of exploration to the game. Now, this isn't a long game - in fact, I conceptualized it to be Nintendo-short. However, the overall idea is there: it's a way to tie together challenges and deepen the player's understanding that this game takes place in a wider world than the side-scrolling environments that are easily encountered.</p>

				<h4>Blah blah blah. Webplayer?</h4>
				<p>Not yet...patience, my fans/apprentices...all will be revealed soon enough!</p>

				<h4>First, Your Feedback</h4>
				<p>After much discussion and feedback, it has been decided by you, fans: The Hero's Journey will feature a top-down world map. Now, back to our regularly scheduled programming.</p>

				<h4>Tale of One Cities</h4>
				<p>I've been working on the Village demo this week, and to my great dismay found some bugs in technology inherited from my old project, Thora! While I resolve the map-change bug, I do have a screenshot for you... <i>(Working on restoring screenshot!)</i></p>

				<p>I walled off the entrances to the town due to an interesting side effect of the scene change bug, but I'm particularly proud of the small village of Dunamne. This will merely be the first of the game's awe-inspiring collection of three cities!</p>

				<p>I'm also challenging myself to work on the progression of the NPCs. While they have a necessarily limited selection of text (I'm not taking a lot of time on them A) because I'm not a writer by trade, and B) I want to work on actual gameplay,) I also want to flesh them out to make them more effective characters and sources of JRPG satire.</p>

				<h4>Webplayer wa doko desu ka?</h4>
				<p>This week, I'm working on two things - resolve the Scene Change bug, and actually implementing the game-phase change system from the week before last. The final demo - presumably to be released next week - will feature the village of Dunamne with a sample story scene, that causes the entire town to say different things.</p>

				<p>Until next week, fans!</p>

				<h4>Graphics</h4>
				<p>I've started some basic work on the towns of The Hero's Journey, including some NPCs:<i>(working on getting image back!)</i></p>

				<p>Work on them is continuing, but they follow the same rules as the Guards and the King: text to guide you and provide world flavor. Nothing special.</p>

				<p>Of course, since you see those new blocks (and the way I've done the house interior, for that matter), let's talk about my level design. Originally I was doing a pure cutaway. Nope, not anymore. I felt it more effective that, as I'm using a marriage of 3D and 2D to use my 3D tiles to emphasize the fact that this is a 3D world. With only a few more polys to my scenes, Aylea Castle now looks like this:<i>(working on getting image back!)</i>

				<p>With some positive feedback from <strong>snowconesolid</strong>, I decided this is the way to go with my level design in the game. Caves may or may not still use the old setups, I haven't decided.</p>

				<h4>Webplayer?</h4>
				<p>Unlike usual, I updated it a couple of days ago (4/20/2013), but it's quite playable. As always, feedback is loved.</p>

				<h4>Graphics</h4>
				<p>This week, I mostly created extra doodads for Aylea Castle, as well as some re-work on the castle block textures. The Castle - for players not attempting the Suicidal Achievement - is important!</p>

				<p>Also, created a sprite for King Roderick Broderick Mervin Garvin Aylea XXXIV. I'm working on Princess Nelda's two sprites right now. Why is this significant? It led me to...<i>Working on adding the image!</i></p>

				<h4>Systems</h4>
				<p>...beginning work on the Game Phase system. As objectives are completed, NPCs will change their text to better direct the player what to do. As such, I've created a really simple means of checking the Game Phase, and a scene-level script to tell all the NPCs what their lines are. NPCs are horrible actors!</p>

				<p>I'm also working on implementing a slight bit of inertia to the player controls. Not only does a bit of this help with ensuring that the jumping looks right, but also recreates some of the more tactical nuances of The Adventure of Link.</p>

				<p>As of April 15, I got the jump in, though the tuning of the decay is subject to some tuning until it's just right.</p>

				<h4>Music</h4>
				<p>You can hear the world map theme in this week's webplayer!</p>

				<h4>Dude, where's my webplayer!?</h4>
                <p><i>(Old post; link removed!)</i></p>
				
				<p>Have a play, and a look around the castle. Right now the text update, or scripted events aren't working, but that's coming.</p>

				<p>First, thanks for the outpouring of support, criticism, and ideas! FloatingCoder, Caliber Mengsk, and Sherlock Turtle in particular had great observations and ideas that I'm implementing in the game. Be sure to check the development webplayer for some of the fruits of their ideas.</p>

				<h4>Graphics</h4>
				<p>In response to <strong>Floating Coder</strong>, I've began adding Hurt animations and physics to all game entities, as a visual clue that they...well, got hurt. In the uploaded webplayer you may not can see the Hurt animations just yet, but you will notice upon hitting something or being hit, they will knock back slightly, though there are some slight bugs with that.</p>

				<p>However, a treat from fellow forum member Gigabeat:</p>

				<img src='http://forum.unity3d.com/attachment.php?attachmentid=49402&d=1365380627' />

				<p>After posting in the art thread looking for a spot of help on the title pane, Gigabeat came through with this mildly-updated version (not to mention, more accurate kanji.)</p>

				<p>I also created a more muted Castle wall/floor 3D tile. I'll have screenshots up with the monologue text system, as that will be pertinent. Expect that sometime this coming week!</p>

				<h4>Music/Sound</h4>
				<p>This week, I got to write two short MIDI pieces that will be rendered to MP3 later this week and embedded in the original post. The best one is 'Under the Canopy', the theme for the Illusionary Wood. The other is the World Map theme, which may evoke a bit of nostalgia from anyone who's played Final Fantasy IV.</p>

				<h4>Bugfixes/Known Issues</h4>
				<p>Sadly, the controls still need lots of love - as many have pointed out, in a sidescroller, controls have to be good and responsive. I've implemented some slight performance improvements, but there's still problems that I need to solve behind the scenes. As always, I'll have a webplayer up as soon as I do, but I won't comment on it until the next Sunday Evening post after the fact.</p>

				<p>However, with some help from AustinK, I've fixed the bug that caused players to be unable to take partial jumps. Now, the longer you hold the jump button (space bar), the longer you will jump, up to the maximum allowed height. Enemy AI has not been affected by this change.</p>

				<h4>New Features</h4>
				<p>The new features for this week are ones you can't see, because they aren't in a scene that is accessible in this build.</p>

				<p>First, I've added a monologual text system, so that those NPCs you pass in the Castle and in towns can give you helpful hints of where to go, what to do, or more efficiently make fun of JRPGs. I'm working out the kinks, but I want it to have its own little showtime next week if possible.</p>

				<p>Further, I'm designing a new enemy, the Steelguard. Unlike the Shototo and Slime, this guy makes you use your sword and shield, but not jump button. His role is to engross you in a sword fight.</p>

				<p>The webplayer link in the original post has been updated! Until next week, friends and fans!</p>
