				<p>This week, I've been working on the third and final town in <i>The Hero's Journey</i> - Karikako Fishing Village!</p>
				
				<h4>It takes a Dev to raise a Village</h4>
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-37.png' />
				
				<p>Karikako Fishing Village is a small town by lake Aylea, built around the Aylean Royal Family's summer villa.  In addition to good fishing, scenic vistas, the protective shelter of the southeastern mountain ranges, and good real estate prices, an Evil Lord has recently moved in and started causing trouble.</p>
				
				<p>The other reason why Karikako Fishing Village is being implemented now?  There's a mini-dungeon hidden in the town, that has a key item that will be needed to progress with the plot.  You cannot even hope to access the minidungeon unless you've gotten to the correct point in the plot, though...</p>
				
				<h4>Can I try this minidungeon in, y'know, a webplayer?</h4>
				<p>First things first: I need to finish Karikako first!  That will be in the next webplayer...stay tuned!</p>

				<p>This week, I took it slow on <i>The Hero's Journey</i>, as I was working on the next boss: Lady Barbariccia!</p>
				
				<h4>Villainous Assets</h4>
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-36.png' />
				
				<p>Lady Barbariccia is the second boss of <i>The Hero's Journey</i> and is fundamentally different from Garlan.</p>
				
				<p>First, Lady Barbariccia is an intellectual, unlike Garlan who Tim has to fight blow-for-blow.  She dosen't wear heavy armor, because of this (though she still rocks some skull-emblazoned pauldrons and that odd crown), and instead relies on her potent arsenal of Blue Magic for her combat needs.</p>
				
				<p>Also, as you can see I've built her 'intro' scene, the Manseles Mountain Paths.  The Manselesean Mountains are clear in the background, but more to the point, it is at this point in the game that things will start to get more complex.  For one thing, you'll be forced to find a key item outside of a dungeon, with clues that the player has to piece together by talking to NPCs!  Also, certain sidequests will open up at this point.</p>
				
				<h4>A Quest!  May I undertake it in a webplayer, prithee?</h4>
				<p>Not this week...but, I'm getting close to another webplayer, so fret not!</p>

				<p>This week, some less-glamorous, but totally necessary work was done on the game.</p>
				
				<h4>I hereby grant you a title.</h4>
				<p>I've been working on the startup sequence of the game.  By 'startup sequence', I'm referring to the startup scene, that prepares everything, as well as the Title Screen which is the player's initial access point to the game.</p>
				
				<p>One of the lessons learned earlier in my dev cycle is that my GUI needs to scale well to the aspect ratio of the screen the player is playing on; sure, I could attempt to force the player to play my game in 640x480 resolution, but what about people with widescreen?  Sadly, it's a problem I'm still solving; while my buttons, sliders, checkboxes, labels, and various other GUI controls all work as they 'should', images, which form the backdrops for most of these controls are generally just images, and images aren't behaving in my relative setup.</p>
				
				<h4>I've been saved!</h4>
				<p>The other thing I've been working on is the save and load system.  Not glamorous, filled with cool visual effects, but it's a necessity - people have to stop playing my game sometime, even as short as my game is.  Fortunately, my setup allows me to keep track of what the player does and does not have; all I'm working on are good ways to save the file correctly under the correct circumstances; Android devices will require special permissions, PC can save to a specific location, webplayer can't save at all thanks to Unity's security model for webplayer.</p>
				
				<p>When development gets significantly closer to completion, I'll be asking for volunteers to test the Save/Load system.  Until then, just realize that I've got it in and am testing it in-house.</p>
				
				<h4>Speaking of, player?</h4>
				<p>No, not this week; I'm working on the back end concerns, and making sure my preview build can show off the title screen without trying to do things that can't be done.</p>

				<p>This has been a huge week for <i>The Hero's Journey!</i>  I've been working on some improved special effects, a brand new enemy you'll see a lot of in Barbariccia's Evil Castle, and some bugfixes to previous problems.</p>
				
				<h4>Teleghast for you, sir!</h4>
				<p>First things first, I would like you to meet the new enemy, the Teleghast!<br /><br />
				
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-34.png' /><br />
				<h6>Pictured here: the most annoying ghost you'll ever want to bust.</h6>
				
				The Teleghast will teleport around to various points, and fire a Blue Magic projectile at you.  At first, you can't do a lot about the blue magic, until you find a certain powerup.  Of course, the Teleghasts are vulnerable to being stabbed; they do stick around to watch their bullet fly away for a short time, but will swiftly teleport away.<br /><br />
				
				The Blue Magic projectile is something I'm especially proud of!  It combines legacy particles, existing scripts, and a custom tag to make for an effect that I didn't have to sprite.  This was a positive particle experience, and is one I may go back and apply to the Shototo's particle.  Only, instead of making that one a flashy bit of Blue Magic, it'll probably be a big ball of dust that can injure Tim for half a heart.</p>
				
				<h4>Bugfixes Ahoy!</h4>
				<p>Another thing I did this week was fix various bugs that have crept in over time.<br /><br />
				
				First, NPCs face you as you pass them, once again.<br /><br />
				Also the Shototo's AI was broken, making it do absolutely nothing; this has been remedied.<br /><br />
				
				I added some interior music to the houses, as it was found to be a bit distracting that the Town music would restart once you entered a house; it was felt that, true to the inspiration for this game, that house interiors should have their own music.  At some point I intend to go back to the Maestro audio controller and do something with it such that the music system lives across scenes, but that's too much work as it is; I've already blown my time budget once, I need to get this game finished!<br /><br />
				
				More bugfixes, and features, and content, next week!
				</p>
				
				<h4>Speaking of, webplayer?</h4>
				<p>
				<a href='./webplayer.html'><i class='icon-gamepad'></i> I never thought you'd ask.</a><br /><br />
				
				Note that you'll only see the fruits of the bugfixes in this build; the Teleghasts will come into play sometime this week, as I flesh out the next plot events, and start on Barbariccia's Evil Castle.
