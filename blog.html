				<p>This has been a huge week for <i>The Hero's Journey!</i>  I've been working on some improved special effects, a brand new enemy you'll see a lot of in Barbariccia's Evil Castle, and some bugfixes to previous problems.</p>
				
				<h4>Teleghast for you, sir!</h4>
				<p>First things first, I would like you to meet the new enemy, the Teleghast!<br /><br />
				
				<img src='./images/sidescroller-34.png' /><br />
				<h6>Pictured here: the most annoying ghost you'll ever want to bust.</h6>
				
				The Teleghast will teleport around to various points, and fire a Blue Magic projectile at you.  At first, you can't do a lot about the blue magic, until you find a certain powerup.  Of course, the Teleghasts are vulnerable to being stabbed; they do stick around to watch their bullet fly away for a short time, but will swiftly teleport away.<br /><br />
				
				The Blue Magic projectile is something I'm especially proud of!  It combines legacy particles, existing scripts, and a custom tag to make for an effect that I didn't have to sprite.  This was a positive particle experience, and is one I may go back and apply to the Shototo's particle.  Only, instead of making that one a flashy bit of Blue Magic, it'll probably be a big ball of dust that can injure Tim for half a heart.</p>
				
				<h4>Bugfixes Ahoy!</h4>
				<p>Another thing I did this week was fix various bugs that have crept in over time.<br /><br />
				
				First, NPCs face you as you pass them, once again.<br /><br />
				Also the Shototo's AI was broken, making it do absolutely nothing; this has been remedied.<br /><br />
				
				I added some interior music to the houses, as it was found to be a bit distracting that the Town music would restart once you entered a house; it was felt that, true to the inspiration for this game, that house interiors should have their own music.  At some point I intend to go back to the Maestro audio controller and do something with it such that the music system lives across scenes, but that's too much work as it is; I've already blown my time budget once, I need to get this game finished!<br /><br />
				
				More bugfixes, and features, and content, next week!
				</p>
				
				<h4>Speaking of, webplayer?</h4>
				<p>
				<a href='./webplayer.html'><i class='icon-gamepad'></i> I never thought you'd ask.</a><br /><br />
				
				Note that you'll only see the fruits of the bugfixes in this build; the Teleghasts will come into play sometime this week, as I flesh out the next plot events, and start on Barbariccia's Evil Castle.
